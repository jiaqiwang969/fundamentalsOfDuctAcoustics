- Fig5_deriv03.m: Fig 07 prove?

 - Fig5_deriv04.m: Does green function is possible to plot? with solid wall.
 
   Not really sure, code is here, to be vertifying...
   
 - Fig5_deriv05.m: fig8 prove?

 - Fig5_deriv06.m: fig8 extends to 3D, which includes "n" in z-axis, all this mode add together is reall word!

- Fig5_deriv07.m: Assume the amplitudes of this modes is random at first, so what? Please think about it, when w=20, which level of "m" at least is cut off? 

  Answer: This derives the cut-off boundary of the duct modes related to "m". So can we plot it?
